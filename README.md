# Legend Simulation Analysis

This repository contains the analysis code and documentation for the legend simulation.

## Description
The legend simulation analysis is based on the Warwick-LEGEND fast simulation. This project aims to analyze the simulation data and extract meaningful insights.

## Getting Started
To get started with the legend simulation analysis, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies. (TBD)

2. Clone this repository:

3. Navigate to the project directory:

4. Run the analysis code. (TBD)

## Directory Structure
- `data`: Will be the output of the Warwick-Legend Simulation (link tba).
- `code`: Contains the analysis code and scripts.
- `results`: Stores the output files and generated visualizations.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you want to contribute to the legend simulation analysis, please follow the guidelines in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
