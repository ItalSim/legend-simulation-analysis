# Analysis scripts

- opanalysis.py: collection of functions that are used by other scripts; 
- panel_per_evt.py: used to compute the number of panels hit by optical photons by neutron capture on $^{41}$Ar or on H and compare results in inner and outer volume (i.e. inside vs outside the neutron moderator).
